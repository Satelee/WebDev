Pushing all websites/apps/frontend/backend stuff from the complete webdev course on udemy here for u lovely people to see me progress in the world of webdev :)

In this readme file I'll give a quick description of each file contained in this repository so you can all see my progress as I learn HTML/CSS/JS! 

# MyFirstWebsite
Literally my first ever website, it has basic HTML and a little CSS to give it some colour. There are three different pages, a homepage, gallery and subscription page.

### Pages in this website:
    - index: homepage, a lot of rambling and getting used to all the syntaxing
    - cursedcats: images of 10 cursed cats
    - subscribe: allows users to subscribe for more cursed cat content by completing a form

# FinalFantasyXVWiki
Just for fun, this website will only be using the basic HTML and CSS I learnt through the practice website. Nothing crazy but I thought it would be good to apply the skills I have learnt into something that could be more usable or legit.

### Pages in this website:
    - index: homepage, using place holder text but game information would be placed here
    - characters: character cards for the 4 main characters
    - music: includes album for the OST + tables including track titles from each disc
    - gallery: 9 images from the game organized by using more CSS concepts

# Tea Party
This website was my first real expeirence using CSS and creating my own style sheet to use and implament throughout the website. Again, nothing extrordinary but just to get me used to how CSS works & how I can use it throughout a website. 

 ### Pages in this website:
    - index: homepage, using lorem ipsum where a cute welcome message and introduction may go.
    - about: more details about said tea party and what it may entail.
    - register: register for the tea party.


# Mononoke Gallery
A very simple yet responsive immage gallery with 6 carefully selected images from the 2007 horror anime 'Mononoke'. The website utilizes flexbox & the CSS transform and transition properties upon hover to make it more interactive.

## Pages in this website:
    - index: homepage, includes the gallery and title.
