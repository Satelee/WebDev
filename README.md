Pushing all websites/apps/frontend/backend stuff from the complete webdev course on udemy here for u lovely people to see me progress in the world of webdev :)

In this readme file I'll give a quick description of each file contained in this repository so you can all see my progress as I learn HTML/CSS/JS! 

# MyFirstWebsite
Literally my first ever website, it has basic HTML and a little CSS to give it some colour. There are three different pages, a homepage, gallery and subscription page.

# FFXV Wiki Page
Just for fun, this website will only be using the basic HTML and CSS I learnt through the practice website. Nothing crazy but I thought it would be good to apply the skills I have learnt into something that could be more usable or legit.
